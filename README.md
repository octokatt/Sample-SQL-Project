# Sample SQL

This is a sample of some basic SQL exercises I completed in an hour.  

`KKennedy_Data_Science_Product_Analytics_exercise.pdf` is a complete version of the created and formatted document I created, along with the answers to the SQL exercises.  The original document containing the initial questions and formatting is available in `Data_Science_Product_Analytics_exercise.pdf`.

I have more tricks available in the [wiki-code](https://github.com/octokatt/wiki-code) repository, and also a lovelly [SQL Tricks Gitbook, available here](https://katt.gitbook.io/sql/).
